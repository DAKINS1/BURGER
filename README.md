# EAT DA BURGER

A logger (in this case- burgers!) created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars that followed the MVC design pattern. Node and MySQL was used to query and route data into the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

User entered burgers they wished to eat, which was then logged to the left. When the user wanted to eat the burger- it was sent over to the right. User was also able to delete the burger from the list.
